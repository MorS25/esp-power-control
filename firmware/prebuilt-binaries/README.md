Flashing pre-built binaries
----------------------------------

Prebuilt binaries can be flashed to ESP8266 boards via serial port.

Required hardware:
* ESP8266-based board,
* USB-TTL adapter (TTL-level, not RS232!)

Required software:
* esptool (https://github.com/themadinventor/esptool)
* OR, on Windows: http://www.electrodragon.com/w/ESP8266_firmware_flasher
  (untested but should work)

For Linux and MacOS, there is a script, `flash.sh` which can be used to
automate the flashing procedure.

Flashing process
------------------------

1. Connect ESP to your serial port (RX to TX, TX to RX, GND to GND, VIN to
   +5V). Do not plug the serial port in USB port of your computer yet.
2. Start the ESP in bootloader mode. See
   https://github.com/themadinventor/esptool#entering-the-bootloader for
   how-to.
3. Launch the flashing script with serial port device or name as argument.

On success, you should see something like this:

    $ ./flash.sh /dev/ttyUSB0

    Erasing flash...
    Wrote 524288 bytes at 0x00100000 in 49.1 seconds (85.4 kbit/s)...

    Leaving...

If using GUI to do the flashing you can look up settings in the flashing script
(which .bin file goes to what memory location).
